<p> This dataset was imported and visualized. The purpose of this is to help create hypothesis testing with insurance data. </p>

## Do smokers have higher insurance charges than non-smokers?

#### Final Hypothesis
pvalue=2.575322662587431e-104

The p value was less than 0.05 for the Welch's t test, meaning we reject the null hypothesis and support the alternative hypothesis. There is a significant difference in insurance costs between smokers and non-smokers

## Are men more likely to smoke than women?

#### Final Hypothesis
pvalue = 0.006548143503580696

The p-value is less than 0.05. We reject the null and support the alternative hypothesis. There is a difference between men and women who smoke.

## Do different regions have different charges on average?

#### Final Hypothesis
pvalue = 0.07468847911322242

The p-value is greater than 0.05. We failed to reject the null and support the null hypothesis. There is no significant difference in charges between regions
